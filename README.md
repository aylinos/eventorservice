# Eventor: Events Management & Organization Website
Personal project in semester 3. Finished development on 22 January 2021

Back-end service:
Spring framework for Java | Maven | MySQL DB (JPA & Hibernate) | JWT token | websockets | request mapping | Git CI/CD pipeline (SonarQube) | Docker (build) Unit & Integration tests (Mockito, AAA) | Selenium tests


Goal:
Develop full stack website using separate Java back-end service and Vue.js front-end client. Connect through API


Idea:
Website for facilitated management of events. Users with an account can register own private or public events and arrange them with an organized agenda, including review statistics of the popularity of each personal created event. In addition, they are able to search and follow different types of publicly shared events.


Key implementations:
* Multi role authentication & (pre)authorisation (Spring Security framework)
* CRUD events, users, notifications and others
* Real time notifications with websockets
* Image upload
* Validation
* Testing the code using different approaches and tools
